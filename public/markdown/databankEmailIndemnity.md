Databank Brokerage Limited

I/We, **{{var1}}** , the undersigned, here acting in the capacity
of **{{var2}}** authorise and instruct Databank Brokerage Limited to execute within
the earliest possible time, the instructions which I am likely to transmit by fax,
telephone and e-mail, with regard to securities transactions generally, in the name
of **{{var1}}** unless otherwise indicated, pending receipt or not of my original
written confirmation, which when issued by me will be annotated with
"_Instructions already given by telephone/ e-mail or fax_".

I am however perfectly aware of inherent risks there may be in transmission of
instructions by fax, telephone and e-mail, such as, but not limited to, delays and
errors in transmission, incomprehension, absence of confidentiality, transmission
by unauthorised persons and loss caused thereby, and agree to bear the consequences
thereof.

- In consideration of your agreeing to carry out my instructions by such means as
  aforesaid, I, the undersigned, here acting in the capacity of **{{var2}}** undertake:

  - to hold you or any of your agents blameless in the execution of such instructions;
  - not to enter any action against you (and in so far as need be); and
  - to indemnify you for all losses and all actions, proceedings and demands that
    might be entered or made against you by any third party as a result of your complying
    with instructions transmitted by the above means, as well as for fees, costs
    and expenses which you might incur in relation to such actions, proceedings
    or demands.

This authorisation is given by me to Databank Brokerage Limited and is valid until
formal revocation by written instructions from me.
