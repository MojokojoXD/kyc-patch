4. ### **Instructions**

   - #### **General**

   1. We shall be entitled to act upon any written (including electronic media)
      or, at our sole discretion, oral instructions reasonably believed to be from
      you or from any other Authorized Person. Where we accept oral instructions,
      we may, at our sole discretion, require you to furnish us with written
      confirmations of such oral instructions. Instructions must be received by
      u s before we may act on them.

   2. Once given, instructions may only be withdrawn or amended with our consent.
      A cancellation or amended instruction is merely a request, and action on such
      a request is not guaranteed. If we cancel your instructions, we may charge
      a fee.

   3. Instructions may be acknowledged either expressly or by our acting upon them.
      Unless we agree otherwise, instructions are effective when we receive them.
      We will not generally acknowledge receipt of instructions other than by acting
      on them. You agree to regularly monitor your Trading Account, and you agree
      to notify us immediately you notice any inaccuracy in effecting your instructions.

   4. You shall promptly and within any time limit imposed by us give any instructions
      we may reasonably request from you in respect of any Services provided hereunder.
      If you do not do so, we may in our sole discretion take any steps at your cost
      and liability we consider appropriate for our or for your protection. You shall
      be solely liable for the consequences of a failure on your part to provide
      instructions to us by any required time once notification of an event requiring
      your instructions has been sent to you.

   5. We may, at our absolute discretion, decline to accept or act in accordance
      with any instructions, accept any payment into your Trading Account, or take
      any action or inaction without being under any obligation to give reasons therefore.
      If we decline an instruction, we may take reasonable steps to notify you promptly,
      but we shall not be liable for any failure to do so. Without prejudice to the
      foregoing, we may decline to accept or act on instructions where we reasonably
      believe that (without limitation):

      1. The instruction is not clear, does not satisfy any requirements that apply
         to the Services, or was not given by you or an Authorized Person;

      2. By carrying out the instruction we may contravene any Market Regulation,
         code or other duty which applies to us or may become exposed to action or
         censure from any Government;

      3. You have not provided us with sufficient funds to effect the instructions.

   6. You authorize us to, at our sole discretion, take any action or inaction
      which we consider necessary or appropriate in the provision of the Services,
      including but not limited to delegating our authority as your agent to another
      or taking any action or inaction to comply with any Market Regulations. You
      agree to be bound by, ratify, and confirm everything done in the exercise of
      such discretion.

   - #### **Authorized Persons**

   7. If you wish to authorize any 3rd party person (provided that such person has
      the capacity to enter into contracts) to give instructions on your behalf,
      please notify us in writing by completing and delivering to us our standard
      3rd party agent authorization form. All appointments of Authorized Persons
      shall be at our discretion, and we may cease to recognize the authority of
      any Authorized Person at our absolute discretion.

   8. All corporate clients must appoint an employee or director as an Authorized
      Person, if a 3rd party agent is not appointed, and proof of such an appointment
      shall be provided to us on demand. We may accept oral appointments for employees
      and directors at our discretion.

   9. Unless and until we are informed in writing that the authority of any Authorized
      Person has been withdrawn, any action taken by us in conforming to instructions
      given under such authority shall be binding on you.

   10. We may act on instructions given by Authorized Persons and may disclose
       Trading Account balances and any other details about your Trading Account(s)
       to Authorized Persons.

   11. We shall not be liable to you in respect of any loss whatsoever and howsoever
       arising from effecting instructions given by or otherwise dealing with an
       Authorized Person, and you shall solely be responsible for:

   - #### **all instructions given by an Authorized Person**

   12. the manner in which an Authorized Person uses your Trading Account.
       If you have selected Authorized Persons to act for you, then subject to
       any specific limitations that we agree when you appoint that person,
       the Authorized Persons may give any instructions for you and may otherwise
       enter into transactions with us for you, including:

       1. entering into agreements with us for the provision of further products
          or services which they consider to be in your interests;

       2. giving us instructions and setting up security procedures for giving
          instructions in connection with services and products;

       3. changing the Authorized Persons at any time.

   13. These Terms shall be applicable to and binding upon any Authorized Person
       appointed by you.

5. ### **Local and Foreign Dealings**

   1. We shall be entitled to carry out all transactions in accordance with Market
      Regulations of the relevant market, exchange and/or clearing house whether
      applicable to you or us. We may take all such steps as may be required or permitted
      by such Market regulations. We shall be entitled to take or not take any action
      we consider fit in order to ensure compliance with the Market Regulations and
      all such actions so taken shall be binding upon you.

   2. We may execute your dealing instructions upon or outside any market or exchange
      and through any clearing house selected by us. You irrevocably agree that,
      in order to give effect to your dealing instructions, we may instruct an intermediate
      broker(local or foreign, as the case may require) selected by us at our discretion
      which may or may not be a third party affiliate of Kestrel. You acknowledge
      that standards in international markets may not be equivalent to those in kenya.
      We will use reasonable endeavors to select third party brokers that will
      provide execution services to an appropriate standard, taking into account
      the standard generally available in the market in which the brokers operate.

   3. We will use reasonable endeavours to conclude any third party contracts on
      terms which, in our reasonable opinion, are standard in the relevant market.

   4. Where you instruct us in relation to foreign markets, you agree to pay on
      demand any fees, charges or other payments levied by third parties in connection
      with such instructions.

   5. Assets and profits arising on settlement or liquidation shall be credited
      to your Trading Account, and losses howsoever arising shall be debited to your
      trading Account. Any debit balance arising as a result of settlement or liquidation
      shall be payable by you forthwith whether or not demanded by us.

   6. We shall not knowingly execute or agree to execute a transaction which would
      result in your having a short position. A short position arises when a person
      contracts to sell investments which he/she does not currently own, intending
      to buy them in the market at a lower price, before the investments are due
      to be delivered to the purchaser.

   7. Subject to clauses 5.8 to 5.10 (inclusive) below, when we execute a transaction
      we will, subject to any specific instructions that you give us and which we
      accept, take reasonable steps to do so on the best terms available to you in
      the relevant market having regard to the size and nature of the transaction
      concerned as well as the circumstances existing at the time of executing
      such transaction.

   8. We may at our discretion aggregate your orders with our own orders or those
      of other clients. We shall allocate the proceeds of such orders among the
      participating accounts in a manner which we believe to be fair and equitable.
      If the combined order is not executed at the same price, we may average the
      prices paid or received and debit or credit your account with the average net
      price. Details of average price may be furnished on request. We believe that
      aggregating your orders in this way shall generally be to your advantage, for
      instance to obtain better execution or reduced foreign exchange or other dealing
      costs by being part of a larger transaction. However, on occasion, aggregation
      and allocation may result in you obtaining a less favorable price.

   9. Where we are unable or consider it undesirable or inappropriate to execute
      your order at once or in a single transaction we may execute it over such period
      as we deem appropriate and we may report to you an average price for a series
      of transactions so executed instead of the actual price of each transaction.

   10. When we execute an order for you, we will consider a number of factors
       in deciding where to route your order for execution. These factors include
       the total consideration payable (taking account of applicable costs), yield,
       speed of execution, likelihood of execution and settlement, the size and nature
       of your order and any potential market impact that may be caused by executing
       your order. We will generally execute transactions based on the
       consideration identified and available to us at the point of dealing, unless
       there is a reason why in our opinion it is not in your best interests to do
       so. You agree that:

       1. the relative importance of the execution factors may vary from transaction
          to transaction depending on the circumstances of the trade and the prevailing
          market conditions;

       2. when we execute your transaction via our electronic dealing systems,
          we may poll different brokers to identify the best available terms; and
       3. if an order cannot be executed automatically, it will be dealt manually
          by our dealing professionals, who will consider the circumstances of each
          deal and decide on the appropriate course of action. This may include
          the prioritization of another execution factor (such as speed or certainty
          of execution among others) over the best market price when in our opinion
          it is in your best interests to do so.

6. ### **Payments and Settlement**

   1. You shall take all action necessary to enable us to effect settlement and
      delivery of instructions and transactions as they fall due in accordance with
      the requirements of the Market Regulations or of the relevant exchange, market
      or clearing house including but not limited to making any appropriate payment
      and or delivering any securities or other assets to us in good time for us
      to complete settlement and delivery. If any payment or delivery is not received
      or is incomplete or incorrect when received we may without notice liquidate
      the transaction or buy in on the market in order to meet our or your
      performance obligations or take such other action as we in our absolute
      discretion may consider appropriate. You irrevocably and unconditionally
      authorize us to deduct or set-off any applicable fees or charges from a
      payment received from you or on your behalf before we credit such payment
      to your Trading Account.
   2. Unless otherwise expressly agreed between us, all payments by you under this
      Agreement shall be made in immediately available funds free of any deductions
      or withholdings and without exercising any right of set-off
   3. We may require you to:
      1. maintain or supplement any deposit or margin in respect of any transaction
         we enter into with you or for you; or
      2. meet any other call for further funds made under the terms of any
         investment made for you or agreed between us against foreign exchange
         fluctuations. where this is the case, you must make any payment and deliver
         any cash or other assets on or before the relevant due date.
   4. We may refuse to act on any instruction or, as applicable, carry out
      any part of a transaction where:
      1. your Trading Account does not hold sufficient cleared funds (or, at our
         sole discretion, Securities or credit limits or other permitted collateral)
         to satisfy all obligations, whether present, future or contingent in relation
         to that instruction or transaction; or
      2. to do so would result in an unauthorized overdraft, uncovered position or
         other unfunded liability, or borrowing against assets in your Trading account
         and we may reverse and settle such transactions at your risk. You accept
         full liability for any resulting losses.
   5. We are not responsible for delivery or payment by the counterparty (or other
      third party) to any transaction we place or execute as your agent. We will
      only make that delivery or payment if we receive the relevant assets or sale
      proceeds from the counterparty.
   6. The Securities settlement conventions and regulations in certain markets which
      apply to the holding of assets or settlement of transactions for you may result
      in a delay before proceeds of sale are received for you or title to a Security
      passes to you.
   7. Where we convert foreign currency, we will use a quoted rate of exchange on
      the Business Day on which the conversion takes place. We may charge commissions
      on foreign currency transactions which we execute for you.
   8. Payments to you will be paid into such account or such manner as is indicated
      in your Client Account opening Form or in such manner as we may deem appropriate
      at our absolute discretion.
   9. Instructions to make payments shall only be acted upon on receipt of a
      proper Payment Order which must be in writing.
   10. If we receive any Payment Order or other instruction and:
       1. we are concerned that it may not have come from you or an Authorized Person,
          it contains incorrect information or is illegible; or
       2. it is for more than a limit we set for security purposes; or
       3. for some other reason, such as suspected fraud or we want to check the
          instruction with you, we may ask you to confirm it in a manner reasonably
          acceptable to us and we will not act on it until you have confirmed it.
   11. You acknowledge that when making electronic payments to an overseas account
       the payment may be processed through an intermediary or clearing bank situated
       outside Kenya. In the case of intermediary or clearing banks situated outside
       Kenya, the legal and regulatory regime applying to such banks will be different
       from that in Kenya. You agree to pay any charge for processing payment levied
       by intermediary and clearing banks and you acknowledge that the charges may
       vary according to each specific institution. such charges are deducted prior
       to the payment reaching its destination account. Once we have issued the payment
       to an intermediary or clearing bank for payment into an overseas account,
       we are not liable for any charges that may have been applied or for any delay
       in the payment reaching its’ destination account. the same applies to:
       1. incoming overseas electronic payments where the destination account is
          held with us; and
       2. any other incoming or outgoing electronic payments.
   12. From time to time, we may add other currencies to the list of currencies in
       which you may hold funds or settle.

7. ### **Fees, Taxes and Charges**

   1. You shall promptly pay and shall be solely responsible for any and all
      charges,commissions, transfer fees, registration fees, taxes (including any
      capital gains taxes payable), duties, fiscal liabilities or all other liabilities
      or costs payable in respect of or in connection with the Portfolio or this
      Agreement.
   2. Our fees and charges are dependent on Market regulations and therefore are
      subject to change from time to time. Further details on our prevailing fees
      and charges may be obtained from our Head of Operations upon request. Our
      charges and fees may be amended from time to time without notice to you.
   3. You have the sole responsibility for the management of your legal obligations
      and tax affairs including making any applicable filings and payments and
      complying with any applicable laws and regulations. we have not and will
      not provide you with tax or legal advice and we recommend that you obtain
      your own independent tax and legal advice tailored to your individual
      circumstances. The tax treatment of securities may be complex, and the level
      and basis of taxation may alter during the term of any investment. you should
      therefore obtain professional tax advice appropriate to your own circumstances
      before investing. We shall not be responsible for claiming, on your behalf,
      any entitlement or benefit which you may have under any applicable taxation
      treaties or arrangements.

8. ### **Reporting Transactions**

   1. For instructions effected locally, we shall send to you a confirmation, such
      as a contract note, in respect of each transaction within the time required
      by the Act. If we have instructed an intermediate broker on your behalf,
      the confirmation may be a copy of the confirmation sent to us by the
      intermediate broker.
   2. Any confirmation or account statement which we give in writing shall be deemed
      correct, conclusive and binding on you if not objected to in writing by you
      within three (3) Business Days of delivery to you of the confirmation or we
      notify you of an error therein within the same time period.

- ## Part C: Client Assets

9. ### **Nominee Services and Custody**

   1. Subject to agreement with you, we may hold or deal in your Securities in
      trust through a nominee. Such securities will be registered in the name of
      such nominee as Kestrel may determine from time to time to hold client Securities
      in trust (presently “Kestrel Capital nominees Limited”, a wholly owned subsidiary
      of kestrel).
   2. All Securities purchased or otherwise acquired by us as your nominee shall
      be registered (except for bearer stocks) in the name of our nominee or the
      name of another custodian appointed by us. Documents of title to bearer
      securities and assets shall be kept separately from any documents of title
      to bearer securities and assets belonging to you in our own physical possession.
      Bearer or other non-registered Securities may not always be held by us directly
      but may be held by one or more third parties (including clearing systems,
      custodians and overseas agents) directly or indirectly, and may be for its
      or their account.
   3. You should note that nominee account holders shall not receive certain
      entitlements, such as annual report and accounts, nor attend annual (or other)
      meetings and vote at such meetings.
   4. Overseas/foreign investments may be registered or recorded in the name of
      a custodian or in our nominee’s name in one or more jurisdictions outside
      Kenya where we determine that, due to legal requirements or the nature of
      market practice in the jurisdictions concerned, it is in your best interests
      or it is not feasible to do otherwise. As a consequence of this, your investments
      shall not be segregated from investments belonging to us or our nominee and
      therefore your protection may be less should a default occur on the part of
      the person in whose name the investments are registered or recorded.
      Investments belonging to you which are held overseas may be subject to
      different settlement, legal and regulatory requirements than those which
      apply within Kenya. We accept no liability for the default of any nominees,
      custodians or third parties.
   5. Investments registered or recorded in the name of a nominee shall be pooled
      with those of one or more of our other clients. Accordingly your individual
      entitlements may not be identifiable by separate certificates, physical documents
      or entries on the register or equivalent electronic records. In the event
      of an irreconcilable shortfall following any default or failure by the
      custodian responsible for pooled investments, you may not receive your full
      entitlement and may share in that shortfall pro-rata to your original share
      of the assets in the pool. When corporate events(such as partial redemptions)
      affect some but not all of the investments held in a pooled account we shall
      allocate the investments so affected to particular customers in such fair and
      equitable manner as we consider appropriate (which may without limitation
      involve pro rata allocation or impartial random selection).
   6. Where we act as a nominee, we shall collect any dividends, interest, payments
      or other entitlements to which you may be entitled and of which we are notified
      and shall remit to you such dividends or interest as soon as possible after
      deduction of any taxes and duties payable or credit them to your account.

10. ### **Client Money**

    - any money which we hold for you shall be held as client money in accordance
      with the Act. We may pass money held for, or received from, you to a third
      (or settlement agent) to hold or control in order to effect a transaction
      through or with that person or to satisfy your obligation to provide collateral
      (for example a margin requirement) in respect of a transaction. You acknowledge
      and agree that if such a person is outside Kenya, the applicable legal and
      regulatory regime shall be different from that of Kenya and your money may
      be treated differently from the position which would apply if your client
      money had remained in Kenya. All fees, costs or charges incurred as a result
      of holding or paying out money held by us (or on our behalf) under this Agreement
      shall be borne and promptly paid by you as and when they arise. We shall not
      in any way be liable for any costs or charges incurred by us (or on our behalf)
      as a result of any money held, paid to or dealt with on your behalf under
      this Agreement. As Kestrel is not a licensed deposit taking financial
      institution, Kestrel will generally not pay interest on client money held
      by us unless specifically agreed in writing beforehand for a specific amount,
      time period and interest rate. This condition also recognizes the fact that
      client money is generally held in non-interest bearing call accounts at banks.

    1. You must ensure that, when purchasing an investment, you have sufficient
       funds available to pay in full for the investment on the settlement date.

          for which settlement is outstanding to recover the amount of any shortfall;
          and
       4. sell at the prevailing market price, sufficient of your other Securities
          to recover the amount of any shortfall.
    2. We will act reasonably in deciding whether to take any of the Default
       Actions and which of those actions to take, having regard to the relevant
       circumstances at the time. We may, for example, take into consideration market
       conditions and the rules of any clearing house.
    3. If we need to take any Default Action:
       1. you will be liable for and shall indemnify us in respect of any losses
          we incur in connection with the default Action; and
       2. we will notify you of the action we have taken, together with the details
          of any amounts that you are required to pay as a result.
    4. Any crediting to your Trading Account of cash or investments is subject to
       reversal if, in accordance with market Regulations, the delivery of investments

       fiscal liabilities and all other liabilities and costs (including withholding
       taxes)in connection with this Agreement from payments due to you orotherwise
       from the Portfolio (or part thereof).
    2. Without prejudice to clause 12.1, if we do not receive either cash or Securities
       when due in respect of any transaction which we are to settle or execute with
       or for you, or you do not take all steps necessary to secure the due and
       prompt execution and settlement of any such transaction, or you fail to
       meet or we believe in good faith that you are about to fail to meet any
       other liability to us or any third party, we may without prior notice cancel,
       close out, terminate or reverse all or any transactions, buy in to settle
       or close any short position created by you, and sell, realise, charge, pledge

       or commitment undertaken by or for you.

       receiver or levy a receivership or debt recovery charge if you fail to fully
       pay your debts on the due settlement date. If you have not settled, or
       delivered appropriate settlement instructions for your trading Account or
       nominee account(s), by the due date for settlement, then you shall be responsible
       for and agree to keep us indemnified against any losses incurred by us as
       a result, including without limitation, market buy-ins, fines and other
       market censures or any actions we take as a result thereof.
    4. Subject to due compliance with Market regulations in connection with any
       such disposal, we shall not be liable to you in respect of any loss arising
       nor in respect of any choice made by us or any third party in selecting the
       Portfolio sold or disposed of. The proceeds of any sale or disposal of such
       Portfolio (net of costs and expenses) shall be applied in or towards discharge
       of your liabilities and we shall account for any balance. In the event that

14. ### **Risks associated with the Services**

    1. All investment is subject to risk and the degree of risk is a matter of
       judgment and cannot be accurately pre-determined. We give no warranty or
       assurance as to the performance or profitability of your transactions with
       us or your Portfolio or any part thereof.

    2. Transactions involving local and foreign investments may involve significant
       risk. Any instructions or investments relating to local or foreign investments
       and markets may be illiquid and unsuitable for all investors. The value of
       or income from any local or foreign investments may fluctuate and/or be
       affected by changes in exchange rates. Only investors with sufficient knowledge
       and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the relevant
       merits and risks should consider transacting in local and foreign investments
       and markets.

    3. Where you appoint us to act as your nominee, we will act when instructed in
       writing by you and you accept that such instruction is given at your own risk.
       In the absence of such instruction, we may at our sole discretion act on your
       behalf in such manner as we will deem fit.

    4. Should you instruct us in writing that Securities purchased through us be
       registered in the name of some other person whom you specify, the consequences
       of registration carried out in accordance with your instructions are entirely
       at your risk.

    5. You may, at your sole risk, instruct us to execute an order outside a
       regulated market. risk Disclosures

    6. The value of investments and the amount of income derived from such
       investments may fluctuate(decrease or increase). All investments may be
       affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic market conditions
       such as the interest or exchange rate environment, or other general political
       factors in addition to more company or Security specific factors.

    7. Some investments may be very illiquid, meaning that they are infrequently
       traded, and hence it may be difficult to sell within a reasonable timeframe
       or at a price which reflects “fair” value. In extreme cases an investment
       may be non-readily realizable.

    8. Where any transaction is executed by us as agent for you (including
       overseas transactions), delivery or payment (as appropriate) by counterparty
       or any other party to the transaction is at your entire risk.kestrel Capital
       (East Africa) Ltd 8 Terms & Conditions of business

    9. Investments denominated in foreign currencies may have additional risks
       related to the relevant exchange rate. Movements in exchange rates may cause
       the value of an investment to fluctuate either in a favorable or unfavorable
       manner.

    10. The price volatility of equity markets may change abruptly and should not
        be assumed to follow historic trends. In adverse market conditions,
        irrecoverable capital losses could be incurred. In the worst case, a company
        or other investment may fail and the value of its equity may reduce
        drastically. Examples of typical characteristics which could heighten
        equity investment risks are:

        1. low market capitalization;
        2. product set that is undiversified or reliance on single markets as a
           major source of income;
        3. significant reliance on borrowing as a source of finance; or

        4. significant level of fixed costs to pay, irrespective of output,
           production or turnover levels

    11. Transactions in foreign exchange and derivatives carry a high degree of risk.
        The amount of initial margin may be small relative to the value of the
        foreign exchange or derivatives contract so that transactions are “leveraged”
        or “geared”. A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately
        larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit; this
        may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of
        initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with us to maintain
        your position. If the market moves against your position and/or margin
        requirements are increased, you may be called upon to deposit additional
        funds on short notice to maintain your position. Failing to comply with a
        request for a deposit of additional funds within the time indicated may
        result in closure of your positions by us on your behalf and you will be
        liable for any resulting loss or deficit.

    12. Any income you receive from your investment in a collective investment
        scheme may vary with the dividends or interest paid by the underlying investments
        and therefore may fall as well as rise. collective investment products that
        focus on a country, sector or market index may display greater volatility
        than the wider market and so should be considered as higher risk than more
        widely invested collective investment products.

    13. Before publishing a research recommendation, we or our affiliates may
        have acted upon it or made use of information on which it is based.
        Recommendations and comment in our research publications may be affected
        by subsequent changes in market conditions, particularly in share prices.
        Unless expressly acknowledged by us in writing, these publications are
        not personalized or tailored in any way to your individual circumstances.
        Any recommendations made shall not necessarily be suitable for you and
        should not be treated as a recommendation to you to engage in a particular
        strategy or course of action.
